# ðŸ“Š Database Manager Usability in the GreenifyMe App

The Database Manager within the GreenifyMe app plays a crucial role in understanding and managing
the backend of our Android project. For developers, having a clear view of the database structure
and the ability to manipulate data directly from the app is invaluable. This tool simplifies the
process of managing data objects and ensures that the backend aligns with the app's functionality.

## ðŸ“‹ Panel Database Screen

The Database Manager is divided into two main screens: the Panel Database screen and the Manager
screen. The Panel Database screen allows users to perform actions such as deleting and resetting the
database. This feature is essential for maintaining data integrity and testing new features without
the clutter of old data. The ability to reset the sample database, in particular, aids in testing
scenarios by providing a clean slate for each new test run.

## ðŸ“‚ Manager Screen

The Manager screen is designed to display and manage four different types of objects: Account,
Material, Form, and Track. Each object type has its own list, making it easy to view and interact
with specific data sets. The lists are interactive, allowing for item selection and deletion
directly from the UI. This functionality streamlines data management tasks and enhances the
efficiency of backend operations.

## ðŸ”§ Importance for Developers

By integrating these features, the Database Manager ensures that developers can quickly and easily
manage data within the app, leading to more robust and reliable code. Understanding the backend
structure is critical for developers as it provides insight into data flow and storage, which are
fundamental aspects of any Android project. The Database Manager in GreenifyMe is a powerful tool
that enhances both development and maintenance processes, ensuring the app remains efficient and
effective.
